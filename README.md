# React Application for Fake News Detector

This is a really simple React application that allows people to make requests to the Flask API that runs the machine learning model I built.
You can see the app working [here](https://cgmuro.github.io/fake-news-detector-app-frontend/).

If you want to know more about the logic behind the model you can take a look at this [github repository](https://github.com/cgMuro/fake-news-detector).
